  This snippet renders a list of tags. It's used by default in:
   - blog.liquid, for displaying a list of article tags; and
   - collection.liquid, for displaying a list of product tags.

  Currently active tags will be highlighted, and their link will remove them.
  Currently inactive tags won't be highlighted, and their link will add them.

  If any tags are active, a 'Clear Selected Tags' link will be shown.
